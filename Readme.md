# Gleana

A low-level library for arbitrary long numeric data types (both integer and fractional) with support for arithmetic and 
standard math functions for them and maybe even with an extension to the complex field [planned, concept, no development yet]

## This project is currently just an idea, there won't be anything for several months

// Gotta refresh my higher math and mathematical foundations of computers (aka informatics/computer science) knowledge 
before I take on this, this is gonna be long...
